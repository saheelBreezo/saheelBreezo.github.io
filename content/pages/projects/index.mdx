I love to explore and tinker with new things that involves data. I am passionate about data science & machine learning. Please find my projects at [Github](https://github.com/saheelBreezo).

### 🍃  Spatial Air Quality

/>

An air quality map (PM 2.5 concentration) at a 1 km² spatial resolution on daily basis for pan India. Featured in the [IEA
annual outlook for 2021](https://www.iea.org/reports/india-energy-outlook-2021). Attained an impressive R2 score of 0.85 and a MAE of 18 ugm-3.

### 🔥 GHG Emissions from fires

<GithubLink

  href="https://spacetime.blueskyhq.io/ghg-emissions-fires"
/>

Developed a hybrid model that combines machine learning and empirical methods to estimate daily CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions using NASA FIRMS Fires data and MODIS MAIAC & Sentinel 5p aerosol and Copernicus land cover data.Integrated into the prestegious global [Climate Trace](https://climatetrace.org/) coalition, led by former US Vice President Al Gore, and openly available
as an open-source resource on [GitHub](https://github.com/Blueskyanalytics/ghg-emissions/) under CC by 4.

### 🔥 Fire Predictions

  href="https://spacetime.blueskyhq.io/fire-predictions"
/>

Developed a time series model using LSTM to predict fire counts based on historical fire incidents, available vegetation, and its type and weather conditions.

### 💧 Surface area estimation for water bodies. 

<GithubLink
  languages={["py"]}
  href="https://spacetime.blueskyhq.io/water-quantification"
/>

Developed a daily model for extracting surface water extent from Sentinel 2 optical imagery.

### 💧 Surface water quality estimation 

<GithubLink
  languages={["py"]}
  href="https://spacetime.blueskyhq.io/water-quality"
/>

Developed a model to estimate water quality such as chlorophyl_a, ph, cdom, organic carbon using optical satellite imagery.

### 🏙 Surface Deformation due to ground water depletion

<GithubLink
  languages={["py"]}
  href="https://spacetime.blueskyhq.io/water-quantification"
/>

Explored the capabilities of InSAR technology for the detection of land subsidence induced by unauthorized groundwater
extraction. Produced detailed subsidence maps utilizing resources from ESA Copernicus SNAP and NASA ASF, ensuring
validation against on-ground well data.

### 🍂 Global Landfill Monitoring

<GithubLink
  languages={["py"]}
  href="https://spacetime.blueskyhq.io/landfill-quantification"
/>

Developed a neural net based on UNET to segment landfill sites from satellite imagery, the dataset contains temporal data from 2021 of the major landfill sites from more than 7 countries.

### 🌇 Urban Heat Island Effect

<GithubLink
  languages={["py"]}
  href="https://spacetime.blueskyhq.io/uhi"
/>

Research study to understand the consequences of urbanisation (rising population density, infra, lack of vegetation) on land surface temperature.

### 🌐 Geospatial Services
<GithubLink

An ETL pipeline based on AWS serverless architecture containg geospatial data processing functions. Managed the daily processing of 1 TB of geospatial data, encompassing optical, SAR, and weather data while supporting
20+ geospatial functions.
